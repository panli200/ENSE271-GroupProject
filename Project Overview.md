## Background & Business Need/Opportunity
1. A website that clearly highlights membership benefits and events. 
2. Make the backend easy to use so it is more manageable and less time consuming.  
3. Easy navigation on the website so people can look for the information faster.  
4. Attracting new membership enrollment.
5. A function for taking payments on the website( for job postings, events etc.) 
6. Have their own content which is different from their international site(share IABC regina specific things) like a local career page, local events.
7. Redirect members to the international website for duplicate information(so the board has less content to renew or manage). Also, saves the board members time.
8. Set up 2-way communication from the board to the members and vice versa. For example let members post blogs, events etc.
9. A sign up/ sign in option where members can easily enroll for events etc.
10. Create an option where employers can post jobs themselves.
